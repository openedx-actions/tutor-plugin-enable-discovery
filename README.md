# tutor-plugin-enable-discovery

Github Action to install and enable the Tutor plugin - Open edX Discovery service

This action is designed to work seamlessly with Kubernetes secrets created by the Terraform modules contained in [Cookiecutter Tutor Open edX Production Devops Tools](https://github.com/lpm0073/cookiecutter-openedx-devops).

**IMPORTANT SECURITY DISCLAIMER**: Sensitive data contained in Kubernetes secrets is masked in Github Actions logs and console output provided that the secret was created with the Terraform scripts provided in the Cookiecutter. If you are working a Kubernetes secret created outside of the Cookiecutter then **be aware that you run a non-zero risk of your sensitive data becoming exposed inside the Github Actions log data and/or console output**.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! Please note that this repository uses [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) for automated processessing of commits and pull requests, and package publication for new releases. Please note the following about your commit message:

- pull requests can be approved and merged by any **two** authorized core committers
- only the 'next' branch can be merged to main. Thus, your Pull Request should be created from the 'next' branch
- we use [Angular commit message format](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-format). See below
- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize the first letter
- no dot (.) at the end

### Branches associated with CI automation

| Branch     | Description                                                                                           |
|:-----------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| main       | commits are prohibited. Only accepts automated merges via Github Actions                              |
| next       | this is the branch that I (Lawrence) primarly use for normal code maintenance                         |
| next-major | special use, in the unlikely event that we ever bump beyond version 1.x.x                             |
| beta       | if you're working on something large then merge here before doing anything in 'next'                  |
| alph       | if you're doing some really big then start here                                                       |

### About the Angular commit message format

An example:

```bash
  git commit -m "fix: fix bug in the yadda yadda step"
```

Your commit message should be prefixed with one of the following:

| Prefix   | Description                                                                                           |
|:---------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| build    | changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example - scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm) |
| ci       | changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (examples: Github Actions, CircleCi, SauceLabs)     |
| docs     | documentation only changes                                                                            |
| feat     | a new feature                                                                                         |
| fix      | a bug fix                                                                                             |
| perf     | a code change that improves performance                                                               |
| refactor | a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature                                             |
| test     | adding missing tests or correcting existing tests                                                     |

More generally, less is more: don't use two words where one will suffice. Simple words are better than fancy words.
